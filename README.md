A poison message, for the uninformed, is a "queued" message that can't be processed for one technical reason or another.  Doesn't sound like much of a bother, but due to the way that queues operate, they can muck up the works if left unhandled. 

The WebJobsPoisonDemo demonstrates (a) an improved poison-message handling scheme and (b) a set of easy-to-use WebJobs helper classes.
